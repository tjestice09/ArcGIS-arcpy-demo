# Campground Buffer Tool (ArcPy + ArcGIS Pro)

This project demonstrates basic geospatial analysis using ArcGIS Pro and Python (ArcPy).

## What It Does
- Creates campground points (demo data)
- Runs an ArcPy script to generate 1-mile buffer zones around each campground
- Shows custom symbology (colors) in the ArcGIS Pro map
- [Screenshot included!]

## Technologies Used
- ArcGIS Pro
- ArcPy (Python)
- Custom feature class and buffer analysis

## How to Run
1. Open ArcGIS Pro and load the included `.gdb` if needed
2. Open buffer_tool.py in any text editor and copy the full script
3. In ArcGIS Pro, go to the view tab and open the Python window
4. Paste the code into the Python window and press enter (for me I had to hit enter twice)
5. Buffers will appear around each point
